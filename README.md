# Legacy iOS Kit

- (formerly iOS-OTA-Downgrader)
- **An all-in-one tool to [restore/downgrade](https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit/wiki/Restore-Downgrade), [save SHSH blobs](https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit/wiki/Saving-SHSH-blobs), [jailbreak](https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit/wiki/Jailbreaking) legacy iOS devices, and more**
- Supported on **Linux and macOS**
- **Read the ["How to Use" wiki page](https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit/wiki/How-to-Use) for instructions**
- **Read the ["Troubleshooting" wiki page](https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit/wiki/Troubleshooting) for tips, frequent questions, and troubleshooting**

## Features
- Legacy iOS Kit supports all 32-bit iOS devices, and some 64-bit (A7/A8/A9/A10/A11) devices
    - Devices that received iOS 16 and newer will only have limited functionality (e.g. sideloading) and some features like SSH ramdisk are not supported
    - Legacy iOS Kit defines *legacy devices* as all iOS devices that are vulnerable to checkm8 and older
- Restore to signed OTA versions (iOS 8.4.1 and/or 6.1.3) on A5/A6 devices
- Restore to iOS 10.3.3 (signed OTA version) on supported A7 devices
- Restore supported devices to unsigned versions with SHSH blobs
- Restore to unsigned iOS versions with iOS 7 blobs (powdersn0w)
- Restore supported 32-bit devices to unsigned iOS versions "without" blobs
    - Includes downgrading iPhone 2G, 3G, 3GS, iPhone 4 GSM and CDMA, iPod touch 1, 2, 3, iPad 1
    - "without" is in quotes because powdersn0w uses iOS 5/7 blobs for touch 3 and A4 devices, but it is signed for everyone to use
    - Other devices however are true blobless
- Tethered downgrades/restores to supported iOS versions for A5(X)/A6(X) and some other 32-bit devices
- Jailbreak all 32-bit iOS devices on nearly any iOS version
    - Available on iOS versions 3.0 to 9.3.4 with some small exceptions
- Hacktivation for iPhone 2G, 3G, 3GS, 4 GSM (activate without valid SIM card)
- [FourThree Utility](https://github.com/LukeZGD/FourThree-iPad2) - Dualboot iOS 4.3.x for the iPad 2
- Boot SSH Ramdisk for supported 32-bit and 64-bit devices
- Save Onboard SHSH blobs for supported 32-bit and 64-bit devices
- Sideload IPA files for supported devices on Linux (and macOS)
- Save SHSH blobs from Cydia servers for 32-bit devices
- Enter pwned iBSS/kDFU mode for supported 32-bit devices
- Save onboard SHSH blobs for jailbroken 64-bit devices (deverser)
    - This also saves onboard Cryptex APTicket and seed for iOS 16+ (x8A4)
- Install [TrollStore](https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit/wiki/TrollStore) using SSH Ramdisk for supported 64-bit devices on iOS 14/15
- Clear NVRAM for 32-bit devices
- Device activation using ideviceactivation (especially useful for iOS 4 and lower)
- The latest baseband will be flashed for certain A5/A6 devices (for iPhone 4S, 5, 5C, iPad 4, mini 1)
    - For more info on baseband, go to [Baseband Update](https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit/wiki/Baseband-Update) wiki page
- Dumping and stitching baseband to IPSW (requires `--disable-bbupdate`)
- Dumping and stitching activation records to IPSW (requires `--activation-records`)
- [App Management](https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit/wiki/App-Management) - Install IPA (AppSync), dump apps as IPA, list installed apps
- [Data Management](https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit/wiki/Data-Management) - Backup and restore, mount device, erase all content and settings
- [Misc Utilities](https://github.com/LukeZGD/Legacy-iOS-Kit/wiki/Misc-Utilities) - Pair device, export data and battery info, shutdown/restart device, and more

## Supported devices
- [Identify your device here](https://ipsw.me/device-finder)
- **iPhone 5C and iPad mini 3 devices are NOT supported by OTA downgrades**
    - These devices still support restoring to other iOS versions with SHSH blobs, see below
- See the table below for OTA downgrading support:
